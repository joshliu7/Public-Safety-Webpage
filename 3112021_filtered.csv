The state of Massachusettts does not allow towns and municipalities to regulate the hours of commercial trash pickup.  I will reach out and  inform RSV about the complaint so they can be aware of it and to see if they can work with their trash hauling company to see if they can reschedule after 7am  but this is not a guarantee.
