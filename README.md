# DS 4200 - Chester Square Group C6

ChesterSquareDemo.mp4 contains a demo of the main interactive visualization.

### Instructions
The first step to run the visualization locally on a computer is to install Visual Studio Code. Next you will want to unzip the "ds-4200-c6-master" folder by extracting it and opening this folder in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by selecting "File" in the top left corner then selecting "Open Folder" which will allow you to select the extracted "ds-4200-c6-master" folder. Now you want to install the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code by selecting the "Extensions" tab on the left sidebar. You will search up "Live Server" and select the extension called "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey. You will install this extension. Next you want to locate the "index.html" file in the "ds-4200-c6-master" folder in the "Explorer" tab of Visual Studio Code. On Windows computers right-click "index.html" and on Macs control-click "index.html" to open up the shortcut menu. Select the option "Open with Live Server" at the very top of the menu, which will open up the webpage in browser. The "ds-4200-c6-master" folder includes all the code files for the visualizations and webpage design, as well as files for the data used.
